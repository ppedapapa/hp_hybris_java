If gluten is a concern, great gluten-free options include quinoa and brown rice, or get a little adventurous and give millet a try. Another option is to consider the “cousins” of the whole grains: legumes such as beans, lentils, and peas. Go for quantity and quality!

Eating whole grains as part of a healthy diet is associated with a reduced risk of certain chronic diseases. Whole grains are an important source of many nutrients, including vitamins and minerals, as well as dietary fiber to help reduce lipid levels and may lower the risk of heart disease, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. Whole grains contain B vitamins to convert food into energy, iron to carry oxygen in the blood, and magnesium to support healthy immune and nervous systems. Many whole grain choices are non-GMO foods (e.g., wheat, barley, buckwheat, and oats) and, if organically grown, are less likely to have pesticides than conventionally grown grains, so choose organic when possible. Avoid refined grains like white flour, white rice, or processed crackers, pastas, and snacks. If you are looking for some gluten-free options, include quinoa and brown rice, or get a little adventurous and give millet a try. Another option is to consider the \"cousins\" of the whole grains: legumes such as beans, lentils, and peas.",
